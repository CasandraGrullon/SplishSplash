After reading the project specs, I decided to use the MVC architecture. I kept most of the code within the main ViewController since the project was small. 
The methods left in the view controller are related to the tap gesture functionality.

I kept the circleAnimation and randomColor methods in seperate files to make it easier to access for any future features. 
The circleAnimation method parameters include location, color and a delay that can be manipulated when called for the splish and the splashes.

Overall, I tried to maintain clean code and followed the Swift best practices when writing my code.
